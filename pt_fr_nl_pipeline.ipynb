      "After reviewing the latest segment of the document, it is understood that there are discussions between the KNLTB and the AP regarding the justifications provided by the KNLTB for the processing of personal data. The KNLTB argues that the actions were positively received and had high conversion rates, which benefited both members who used the offers and those who did not. They also emphasized that they made efforts to avoid approaching members who were already subscribers or were on the \"do not call\" registry. The KNLTB also mentioned that the members had been sufficiently informed and had the opportunity to object to the data provision. However, the AP concluded that the provision resulted in the loss of control over members' personal data, constituting an infringement of their privacy. The AP highlighted several factors contributing to the severity of the breach, including the excessive provision of personal data and the lack of necessity for the marketing activities. Additionally, the AP explained the concept of justified interest in processing personal data and concluded that the processing carried out by the KNLTB was not compatible with the original purpose of data collection, which was the execution of the membership agreement. Furthermore, the AP indicated that the measures implemented by the KNLTB did not adequately compensate for the infringement of the data subjects' privacy.\n",

      "- The document explicitly states that the processing of biometric data for time registration and attendance tracking by [VERTROUWELIJK] was considered unnecessary and disproportionate by the authority. This provides further context to the dispute and the reasoning behind the imposition of the fine.\n",
      "- The authority found that [VERTROUWELIJK] not only retained the biometric data of current employees without necessity but also those of former employees, without informing the employees adequately or ensuring their (freely given) consent. The authority considers this a severe violation where the special data of individuals were processed under incorrect conditions.\n",
      "- The authority also considered the duration of the violation, the number of affected individuals, and the lack of adequate information and consent from the employees as factors contributing to the severity of the violation.\n",
      "- The authority noted that [VERTROUWELIJK] failed to take responsibility for ensuring compliance with the GDPR, relying instead on a third party with a commercial interest in the sale of the equipment. This failure was deemed as a violation of the high level of protection required for special personal data.\n",
      "- [VERTROUWELIJK] argued that the violation did not constitute a significant risk to the rights of the individuals and that the biometric data were securely stored and not used for any other purposes. However, the authority disagreed, emphasizing that the essence of the obligation was breached by processing the data in the first place, and the security measures were not the focus of the violation.\n",

      "1. The document is a decision by the Autoriteit Persoonsgegevens (AP) regarding the imposition of an administrative fine on PVV Overijssel.\n",
      "2. The complainant is not explicitly mentioned in the document. However, the defendant is the Stichting Ondersteuning Provinciale Fractie Overijssel Partij voor de Vrijheid (PVV Overijssel), which is a foundation providing administrative support to the provincial faction of the Party for Freedom in Overijssel. PVV Overijssel is considered the defendant in this case, and the complainant appears to be an individual whose personal data was involved in the breach, leading to the investigation and dispute.\n",
      "3. The subject matter of the dispute focuses on the failure of PVV Overijssel to timely report a personal data breach under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The data involved includes the email addresses of 101 recipients, which were visible in the address line of an email. The breach resulted from the inadvertent disclosure of personal data through the sending of an email.\n",
      "4. The data processing involved the sending of an email with visible recipient addresses for the purpose of inviting recipients to a political event. This involved the processing of personal data for communication purposes, specifically for political activities and engaging the recipient audience.\n",
      "5. The complainant claimed that the defendant potentially violates Article 33(1) of the GDPR, which requires the reporting of personal data breaches to the supervisory authority without undue delay.\n",
      "6. The legal authority does not dismiss the submitted complaint or case, as it has issued a decision regarding the imposition of an administrative fine.\n",
      "7. The outcome of the dispute is the imposition of an administrative fine of €7,500 on the PVV Overijssel for the failure to report the personal data breach to the AP without undue delay.\n",
      "8. The authority verified that a Fractiemedewerker of the PVV Overijssel sent an email with visible recipient addresses, and despite receiving a request to be removed from the email list, the recipient continued to receive the invitation emails. The PVV Overijssel failed to report this breach to the supervisory authority.\n",
      "9. The document identifies the violation of Article 33(1) of the GDPR by the defendant for failing to report the personal data breach. The verified evidence supports the breach and the failure to fulfill the reporting obligation.\n",
      "10. The document is a final decision by the Autoriteit Persoonsgegevens regarding the imposition of an administrative fine on the PVV Overijssel for the violation of GDPR.\n",
      "\n",
      "11. After the inadvertent disclosure of personal data through the sending of an email, the PVV Overijssel responded by stating that they had learned from the mistake and taken appropriate internal measures. The AP concluded that PVV Overijssel independently determines the necessary means for reaching and activating its support base in Overijssel, with one of these means being the sending of emails. The AP designated PVV Overijssel as the data controller as defined in Article 4, (7) of the GDPR. The authority reinforced that PVV Overijssel had the responsibility to determine the purpose and means of data processing in the context of these activities.\n",
      "\n",
      "12. The AP determined that the sending of the email constituted a breach of security, leading to unauthorized disclosure of personal data to all recipients. The AP highlighted that PVV Overijssel failed to make a timely report of the breach, thus violating Article 33(1) of the GDPR.\n",
      "\n",
      "13. As per the investigation, PVV Overijssel received a request on January 11, 2019, to remove the email address from its mailing list. However, PVV Overijssel failed to report the breach to the AP within 72 hours of becoming aware of it as required by the GDPR.\n",
      "\n",
      "15. PVV Overijssel, in its response, argued that it was not obliged to report the breach to the AP. However, the AP deemed this to be a serious violation, leading to the imposition of an administrative fine.\n",
      "\n",
      "16. The AP concluded that the breach involved personal data indicating political opinions and was likely to have an impact on the individuals' social standing, resulting in a greater responsibility for PVV Overijssel to ensure a high level of protection for such data.\n",
      "\n",
      "17. The AP, based on its findings, exercised its authority to impose an administrative fine on PVV Overijssel, as provided in Article 83(4) of the GDPR, read in conjunction with Article 14(3) of the UAVG.\n",
